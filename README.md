#📊 CRM-Sales-Analysis 

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of a **CRM-Sales-Analysis** using **SQL and Python**. The objective is to uncover patterns in sales performance, evaluate product success, and monitor quarterly revenue growth.  

Through ranking, win-rate analysis, and revenue breakdowns, the project highlights **which managers and products drive results** and identifies **areas where improvements are needed**. This showcases how structured analytics can transform raw sales data into **actionable business insights**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL (SQLite)** – for data extraction and transformation  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for analysis & visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for workflow and documentation  

---

#### 📊 Analysis Components  

- **Summary statistics & visualizations** – overall sales performance distribution  
- **Team & agent-level comparisons** – ranking based on revenue, win rate, and deal size  
- **Quarterly revenue trends** – quarter-on-quarter growth & performance dips  
- **Product win rates** – evaluation of product effectiveness in the pipeline  
- **SQL queries + Python visualizations** – seamless integration of data analysis  
---
## 🔑 Key Insights  

- **Quarterly revenue growth**: Identified significant surges followed by decline, pointing to pipeline consistency issues.  
- **Team/agent performance**: Clear contrasts between high-revenue agents and those with higher efficiency (win rate/avg deal size).  
- **Product performance**: Certain products consistently drive higher success rates, while others underperform.  
- **Operational balance**: High revenue does not always align with strong win rates, highlighting the trade-off between **deal quantity vs. quality**.

## 📌 Recommendations  

- Strengthen **pipeline stability** to sustain growth beyond high-performing quarters.  
- Provide **targeted training** to balance efficiency and revenue among agents.  
- Reevaluate **low-performing products** (pricing, positioning, or training focus).  
- Share **best practices from top performers** across teams.
